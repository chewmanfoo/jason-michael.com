<p>I'm a full-stack Ruby on Rails developer, a husband and father of two amazing little girls, an avid liberal (a <em>conservative</em> in Chomskyesque) and a Minecraft robotnik.  I love woodworking, the outdoors, camping, hiking, attempting to run.  I love HBO dramas and wasting hours with OpenELEC. I love mankind, and <b>I vote</b> for a more inclusive, peaceful culture.</p>
