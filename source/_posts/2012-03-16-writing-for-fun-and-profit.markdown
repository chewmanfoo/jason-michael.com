I have written a kazillion short stories and one screenplay and have started another.  

<!-- more -->

I want to join some sort of Writer's Guild in North Texas.  I found the following on the web:

  * [Writer's League of Texas](http://www.writersleague.org/) 
    * membership: $50 individual, $80 couple
    * plusses: lots of exposure, State-wide writers to meet and mingle, events are great
    * minuses: mostly in Austin
  * [Dallas Screenwriter's Association](http://www.dallasscreenwriters.com/)
    * membership: #85 individual, $45 each additional family member
    * plusses: local (Dallas, anyways)
    * minuses: expensive
