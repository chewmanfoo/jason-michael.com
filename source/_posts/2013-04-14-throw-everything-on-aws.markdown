I am paying $40 a month to linode for a 1Gb slice with no practical limits on transfers (there may in fact be limits, but I haven't experienced them.)  I'm exploring whether I can move the services I run on linode to AWS, free tier, so save some $$.

I run a wiki and a mail server.

I found this: http://www.inboxs.com/index.php/linux-os/ec2-aws/10-how-to-install-iredmail-on-ec2

The free tier allows Amazon linux as well as ubuntu.  The transfer limits may be an issue with a mail server.  I'm debating on imap mail servers available online. The upshot is that when I get turned into a forward for spam, I have to fight it on my linode server, but the imap provider would be responsible for it (time = money, so it's often a good deal).

More to come.
