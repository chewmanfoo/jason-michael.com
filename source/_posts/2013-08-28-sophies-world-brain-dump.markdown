I've been reading _Sophie's World_, a fictional account of a Norwegian teenage girl who is introduced to the world of philosophy by an stranger. In the book, Sophie explores the major themes of all the major philosophers since antiquity. I intend to outline the key points here, for posterity.

### Antiquity
#### The Myths - 600 years before the birth of Christ

Questions about the world and life were answered by religious explanations handed down from generation to generation through myths.

##### Thor and his Hammer
Norse peasants around 600 BC believed that thunder in the storm was the sound of Thor's hammer.  Thunder is "Thord0n" in Norwegian - it means Thor's roar.  Thor was also the god of fertility.  Thor swung his hammer, made the thunder, then the rain fell and the ground sprouted and soon the people had food to eat.  Thor's wife was Freyja, the goddess of fertility.  Thor and Freyja lived in Asgard, the Norwegian people lived in Midgard, and evil giants lived in Utgard.  If the giants of Utgard kidnapped Freyja and took her to Utgard, then the people of Midgard suffered drought.  But Thor could hurl his hammer at the giants and keep them at bay - and the hammer would always return to him.

In the Eddic poem "The Lay of Thrym", Thor takes a nap and wakes up to find his hammer is gone.  Thor and Loki go to Jotunheimm, the land of the giants, to get it back.  Thrym, the king of the evil giants boasts that he has hidden the hammer seven leagues under the earth.  He'll give it back only if Thor gives up Freyja to be Thyrm's bride.

Thor goes back to Asgard and tells Freyja to pack up.  But the god Heimdall has a brainstorm.  Thor and Loki will dress up like women and go to Jotunheimm pretending to be Freyja and her bridesmaid.  During the wedding feast, Thor eats too much and almost blows their cover but Loki smooths it over.  They make it to the wedding ceremony, and the hammer is brought forth and laid in the bride's lap.  Thor laughs, grabs the hammer and kills all the giants and they all go home.

The myth attempts to explain the seasons - in the winter, Thor must be in Jotunheim trying to get his hammer back.  In the sprint, Thor returns and the prosperity returns.

#### Early Greek Philosophy - The Natural Philosophers
The Greeks at about the same time also had their pantheon of gods which explained natural phenomena.  Homer wrote about the gods and their exploits.  Early Greek philosophers criticized Homer's god stories for being too human and not noble enough.

The Greeks sought to find natural explanations for phenomena, rather than supernatural ones.  Since much of the writings of these philosophers has been lost, all we know of them comes from the writings of Aristotle.

##### Xenophanes - 570 BC
_"Man created gods in their own image"_

##### Thales of Miletus
_"The source of all things is water. Life comes from water - it returns to water when it dies."_

_"All things are full of gods"_

* calculated the height of a pyramid in Egypt by measuring its shadow when the length of his own shadow was equal to his height
* predicted a solar eclipse in 585 BC

Having visited Egypt, it is presumed that Thales observed how the Nile filled with water and life arose - both plants as well as animals (frogs, bugs etc.).  When the Nile fell, life went away.

##### Anaximander - contemporary of Thales
_"This world is one of many worlds in the 'boundless'"_

He thought that all life came from elements which were not of this world.

##### Anaximenes - 570-526 BC
_"The source of all things is 'vapor'"_

He was aware of Thale's theory, but he thought water was only 'condensed vapor/air'.  When it rains, water is pressed form the air.  When the water is pressed, earth comes out.  Air can also be rarefied into fire.  So, air is the source of earth, water and fire.

#### The Eleatics - 500 BC - Natural Philosophers - pre-Socratics
_"How can one substance suddenly change into something else?"_

##### Parmenides - 540-480 BC
_"Everything that is has always existed"_

He also thought that there was no such thing as actual change.  He rejected his senses which could see that things changed because his reason told him that nothing comes from nothing.  He was a *rationalist* - someone who believes that human reason is our primary source for knowledge of the world.

##### Heraclitus 540-480 BC
_"Everything flows.  Nature is in constant change.  That's the essential characteristic of the world"_

_"You can not step twice in the same river"_

_"God (logos) is day and night, winter and summer, war and peace, hunger and satiety"_

He believed in the interplay of opposites - the yin and the yang.  Without winter there could never be spring,  God is the constant transformations and contrasts of nature.  Logos was a _universal reason_ in the midst of the constant change of nature.

##### Empedocles of Sicily 490-430 BC
_"Nature consists of four (unchangeable) elements - earth, air, fire and water"_

_"Love binds things together, strife separates them"_

He distinguishes between "substance" and "force".  He also theorized that the eye consisted of earth, air, fire and water - when the eye sees water, the water of the eye perceives it etc.

##### Anaxagoras 500-428 BC
_"Nature is built up of infinite minute particles (*seeds*) invisible to the eye"_

He believed that since skin and bone were composed of infinitely small particles of skin and bone, we must eat and drink skin and bone to make our skin and bones.  This is like a hologram in that the entire picture is present in a tiny part of it.

He believed that the sun was a huge, red-hot stone and the stars were made of the same stuff the earth is made of.  He believed there might be life on other planets, and that the moon only reflected light.

#### Democritus 460-370 BC

* proposed atomic theory - that everything is composed of tiny, eternal, indivisible particles (*atoms*)
* atoms were reusable infinitely - when you die, your atoms can go into making a tree
* didn't believe in god - a *materialist* - the only things that exist are atoms and the void.
* the atoms are ordered by a natural cause - this cause is knowable by man

#### Fate
Ancient Greeks believed their lives were ordered by Fate.  They sought the advice of the Oracle of Delphi who channeled Apollo through the priestess at Pythia.  Over the entrance to the Oracle was an inscription KNOW THYSELF. 

#### Greek Historians

##### Herodotus 484-424 BC

##### Thucydides 460-400 BC

#### Greek Medicine
Illness was punishment from the gods.  "influenza" means a misalignment with the stars.

##### Hippocrates 460 BC
_"First do no harm"_

_"a sound mind and a sound body"_

Believed that moderation and a healthy lifestyle could help a person avoid illness.  Health is a natural condition.  

#### Classical Philosophy (Athens)
Hermes was the messenger of the gods - "hermetically sealed" means hidden from corruption.  

##### Athenian Democracy
Focus on the individual and their place in society.  Democracy, popular assembly, courts of law.  Public education for democracy to work (master the art of rhetoric). 

##### Sophists
"a wise or informed person" - critical of traditional mythology, rejected fruitless philosophical speculation - *skepticism* - man cannot know the truth about the riddles of nature/universe.  Traveled widely -0 seen many forms of government.  Questioned what was 'natural' vs what was induced by society.

###### Protagoras 485-410 BC
_"Man is the measure of all things"_

right or wrong must be evaluated in relation to a person's needs.  An *agnostic* - asked whether a God exists, replied "the question is complex and life is short".

##### Socrates 470-399 BC
_"The trees in the country side can teach me nothing"_

_"One thing I know and that is I know nothing"_

_"He who knows good will do good"_

Never wrote anything - his words come from his disciple Plato.  Hung around people and studied them.  Was ugly, pot-bellied, bulging eyes, snub nose.  Everybody loved his personality.  Sentenced to death for "introducing new gods and corrupting the youth" in 399 BC.  _Plato's Dialogues_ feature Socrates in discussion with disciples and common people.  Similar to Jesus - unclear whether these are Socrates words or Plato's.   Socrates didn't appear to want to instruct people, he had conversations with them and exposed the errors of their arguments.  He sought to make philosophy mainstream - he didn't teach for money.  A *rationalist* - leaning on man's reason as the basis for knowledge.  Man must use reason, not society, to know right from wrong.    

##### Plato 428-347 BC
29 years old when Socrates drank hemlock and died.  Published Socrate's defense after his death.  Established the Academy - a school for philosophers near Athens.  Confronted pre-Sophist ideas - what is eternal, what is in 'flow'?  He believed in an eternal, external perfection for morals and natural things.  He believed that a philosopher's job was to find these eternal "forms".   Everything in nature was made of a material that time can erode, but in a form that is eternal.  Like a cookie cutter.  These forms he called 'Ideas' - there is a world beyond reality where these ideas lived - it is the World of Ideas.  Knowledge of the world if ideas is true knowledge.  Reality is divided into two regions - senses/feelings - which are not necessarily true, and ideas which are true knowledge.  Man id a dual creature - the flesh is in the world of the senses, the soul is in the world of ideas.  The soul existed before the body - when it gets a body it always longs to return to the world if ideas - this is why man seeks justice, truth.     

###### The Cave in _The Republic_
People are living in an underground cave, tied with their backs to the mouth of the cave.  Behind them there is a fire and people walking in front of the fire, leaving shadows on the cave wall - the people see the shadows and assume this is all there is.  If one of the cave dwellers frees himself from the ropes, he sees the people and the fire.  He sees the people in dazzling clarity.  As he discovers more, he is amazed at the new knowledge but he uncovers new questions.  He also experiences pain with every breakthrough.  He goes skipping through the flowers but soon he starts to feel bad for the suckers still stuck in the cave so he goes back to rescue them.  He tries to convince them of the reality beyond their bondage but they refuse to believe and eventually they kill him.  

###### The Utopian State
A society rules by philosophers.  Like the body: head, chest, abdomen - reason, will and appetite.  Like Hindu caste system.  Women can rule as well as men.  The state should care for children and educate youth.  

##### Aristotle 384-322 BC
A pupil in the Academy.  Born in Macedonia.  Father was a physician.    Preoccupied with natural processes.  Embraced his senses to experience the natural world.  Created terminology used in science.  Logic as a science.  There is no "idea" of a thing - there are just observed characteristics common among like objects.  Humans have innate reason - used to perceive the world.  Chicken eggs contain the potential to achieve the form of a chicken.  *The Final Cause* - the final cause of rain is to make the grass grow.  Interested in categorizing everything in nature.  Animal, Vegetable or Mineral.  Invented the logical proof, *syllogism*.  Believed only living things changed.  God is the "first mover" who started everything in motion.  *Ethics* - three forms of happiness: a life of pleasure, a life of freedom and responsibility, a life of a philosopher.  Believed there should be a balance of the three.  *Politics* - believed man belonged in society.  Three forms of state: monarchy (but beware tyranny), aristocracy (but avoid oligarchy), polity or democracy (but beware mob rule).  Women were incomplete men - children inherit man's characteristics not woman's.  Men give the form, women the substance.  Society (the church) unfortunately accepted Aristotle's views about women.       

#### Hellenism after Aristotle 322 BC through 400 AD

##### Alexander the Great 356 - 323 BC
After Aristotle died, Athens loses dominant role.  But in Macedonia, Syria, Egypt, Greek culture was supreme.  From 50 BC, Rome was dominant player.  Borders between countries disappeared - town square was replaced by a world arena.  *syncretism* - a fusion of many creeds.  In Late Antiquity - agnosticism, skepticism, "The world had grown old".  But Hellenism brought new beliefs about salvation for the soul and eternal life, first pagan then Christian. Boundaries between religion and philosophy disappeared.  Alexandria became center of science and culture.  

##### Antistenes - Cynics Athens 400 BC
Emphasized that true happiness is not external, not money or power or good health.  True happiness comes from freedom from material concerns, once attained it can never be lost.

##### Diogenes
A pupil of Antistenes - owned nothing but a cloak, stick, bag of bread - lived in a barrel.  Once Alexander the Great came by - he asked Diogenes if there was anything he could do for him - Diogenes said 'yes, stand aside, you're blocking the sun'.

##### Zeno - Stoics Athens 300 BC
Zeno gathered his followers under a portico, so "stoa" means portico.   Believed that everything was logos - each person was a small micro cosmos of logos (the macro cosmos).  There was a universal, natural law.  *monism* - there was no difference between spirit and matter. (Plato believed in *dualism*.)  Cosmopolitan, always at parties, always in politics and statesmen.  Marcus Aurelius (121-180 AD) Cicero (106-43 BC)  All natural processes followed unshakable laws of nature (Fate).  Stoicism - accept your fate.

##### Aristippus - Epicurians
_"The highest good is pleasure.  The greatest evil is pain"_

_"Death doesn't concern us - when we live death is not here, when we die we no longer exist"_

The aim of life is to achieve the purest highest sensory enjoyment.  Cynics and Stoics _endure_ pain, Epicurians _avoid_ pain.  

###### Epicurus 341-270 BC 
Founded a school of philosophy in Athens.  Pleasure ethic of Aristippus + atomic theory of Democritus.  

##### Plotinus - Neoplatonism 205-270 BC
Man was a dual creature - soul and body.  At one pole is God, the One, at the other is absolute darkness. There is no existence in the darkness.  Similar to the Cave - the closer you get to the mouth of the cave the closer you get to knowledge of reality - a brilliant experience.  Mystical experiences. 

##### Mysticism
No gulf between man and God/"cosmic spirit"

#### Clash of Cultures

##### Semites
Judiasm, Christianity, Islam.  A linear view of history.  One day history will end.  God intervenes in history at his will.  Preoccupied with writing history.  Holy City - Jerusalem.  No pictures of the godhead.      

##### Israel
God created the world, put Adam and Eve in Eden, they rebelled.  God destroyed the earth with a flood.  God promised to protect the children of Abraham.  Man rebelled so God sent them to slavery in Egypt.  Moses brought them back and God promised to protect them.  God gave Ten Commandments about 1200 BC - before Greek philosophy.  Israel is united on one kingdom - King Saul, King David.  Kings were called messiah, also "son of God".  Kingdom then split into Israel and Judea.  Assyrians conquer northern kingdom in 722 BC.  Babylon conquers southern kingdom in 586 BC.  Temple destroyed - Jerusalem ransacked.  Babylonian captivity until 539 BC when Jews began to return to Israel.  Israel remained in foreign domination until Jesus.  Jews wondered why they constantly got destroyed.  Prophets began to preach that God's wrath was upon them because they failed to keep commandments.  God would redeem in due time and send a Prince of Peace.  

##### Jesus
Messiah was seen as a political figure who would end Roman domination.  Jesus said he was the messiah but he was not a political figure or a warrior.  He preached salvation by forgiveness of God to everyone.  "Kingdom of God" was loving your neighbor.  He cavorted with harlots and said that they were more deserving of forgiveness than the religious men.  He was killed like Socrates.

##### Paul
Pharisee converted to Christianity - confronted Greeks in Athens in the Areopagos, a Jew in Greek philosophy.  Conducted many missionary journeys. Established a *creed* which summed up Christian doctrine.        
 
#### Middle Ages
313 AD Christian religion accepted as Roman Empire religion.  Constantine moved capital to Constantinople 330 AD.  395 Roman empire divided in tow - West empire plundered and destroyed by barbarians in 410 AD.  East continued until 1453 when Constantinople was conquered by the Turks.   529 church closed Plato's Academy in Athens.  Christianity put a lid on Greek Philosophy.  1200 first universities were formed.  Aristotle wisdom remained but all other Greek philosophy was lost.  Constantinople became known as Byzantium.  Mohammad dies in 632 AD.   

##### High Gothic Period
Cathedrals in Europe were built.

##### Augustine 354-430 AD
