I'm back!

I've had a long and sordid love-hate relationship with my laptop here at work.  Summary: it finally died, but not before I managed to backup all my vagrant instances to a usb drive.  Unfortunately I did not backup the correct files so I lost the VM that contained my ultra-high-quality wicked cool corkscrew config that got me through my draconian corporate firewall and out to my digitalocean VM's.

So today, I'm in my server in our CERT env, and I notice that I can just ssh right into my DO vm's on port 443 (apparently we stopped blocking this port/protocol combination in the F5).

It just works, so I can blog again.

Also, for some strange reason, my github pages blog is working again as well.  It just started working on it's own.  I can't explain it - the last time I tinkered with this, it was failing with gem dependecies.

I only the wish the same thing worked with my body shape.  I would love to wake up tomorrow and have the gut I had in middle school.
