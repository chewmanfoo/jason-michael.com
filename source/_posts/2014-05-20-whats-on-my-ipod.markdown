My iPhone is full of audiobooks.  I just bought the 5s with 64 gigs or pure media-holding power - _yep, take a moment right now and envy me_ - so I have a lot of room - everything I have fits on it.

So I thought I'd list all the audiobooks I have on my iPhone and give a brief review. 
<!-- more -->

| Title | Thoughts |
| ------- | -------- |
| _American Fascists_ Chris Hedges | Evangelicals need to be force-fed this book, liberals listen for a good freak-out.  It's well-written and thoghtful. hedges does not mince words. 
| _Anathem_ Neal Stephenson | Gotta listen to it again - didn't understand a thing I heard the first time. 
| _Area 51: An Uncensored History of America's Top Secret Military Base_ Annie Jacobsen | Pretty awesome read.  Spoilers: there's no 'there' there. 
| _Atlas Shrugged_ Ayn Rand | Ayn: I hate myself for loving you.  Her characters are robots who lack real human motivation, her philosophy is unrealistic and cruel, but her stories are pretty damn cool.  I liked _The Fountainhead_ better, though. 
| _Attached The New Science of Adult Attachment and How It Can Help You Find-and Keep-Love_ Amir Levine | - 
| _Bel Canto_ Ann Patchett | This is a sad story. 
| _Blink The Power of Thinking Without Thinking_ Malcolm Gladwell | Gladwell is awesome - this is one of his bests.  Worth a re-listen. 
| _Cell_ Stephen King | Formulaic and predictable but still excellent. 
| _The Count of Monte Cristo_ Alexandre Dumas | - 
| _Daemon_ Daniel Suarez | Worth the listen just for the follow-up _Freedom(TM)_, which is reviewed below. 
| _Darkness, Take My Hand_ Dennis Lehane | Wow 
| _David and Goliath_ Malcolm Gladwell | His newest is his best - a lot of stuff in here I didn't know. Gladwell points out how screwed up our thinking is at times and it makes me sad to realize that this will never change. 
| _Death of the Liberal Class_ Chris Hedges | A lot has happened in the last 30 years - labels have been peeled off of one set of thinkers and smeared on another.  'Liberal' has become an insult.  This is a great book. Is he actually advocating a revolution? 
| _Denialism: How Irrational Thinking Harms the Planet and Threatens our Lives_ Michael Specter | [Deny](http://dailycaller.com/2014/05/19/aussies-to-slash-90-of-global-warming-funding-from-budget/), [Deny](http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2014/01/28/3215971/house-members-deny-climate-change/), [Deny](http://www.skepticalscience.com/argument.php), oh [wait](http://www.slate.com/blogs/bad_astronomy/2014/05/20/polar_ice_loss_antarctica_melting_faster_greenland_more_vulnerable.html).  It might be time to start listening to facts.
| _Doctor Sleep_ Stephen King | I look forward to listening to this. 
| _A Drink Before the War_ Dennis Lehane | A really, really good book. 
| _Duma Key_ Stephen King | My favorite SK book. 
| _Farnham's Freehold_ Robert Heinlein | - 
| _Flash Boys_ Michael Lewis | - 
| _The Fountainhead_ Ayn Rand | My favorite AR book.  She's great in this - she maintains her ideology but she doesn't get too preachy.  The best part of an emotional argument is when the arguer _considers the other side's argument_. 
| _God's Problem - How the Bible Fails to Answer Our Most Important Question_ Bart Ehrman | His testamony of how he left the church and became a critic of faith.  A good read. 
| _The Guns of August_ Barbara Tuchman | Dense dense dense.  Worthy of a re-listen. 
| _The Handmaid's Tale_ Margaret Atwood | This is a great book - wow.  And read by Claire Danes.  Wow.  I *love* the ending. 
| _Herzog_ Saul Bellow | I bought this book so I could say I read it. OK so I read it.  It's very 1940's.  It's pretty good, I guess.  It's the kind of book you either understand or you don't. 
| _The House of Silk_ Anthony Horowitz | From the bargain bin. 
| _Into the Woods_ Kim Harrison | - 
| _Jesus, Interrupted_ Bart Ehrman | Worth a re-listen.  A Good Read. 
| _Just After Sunset_ Stephen King | Awesome SK short stories. 
| _Killing Floor_ Lee Child | - 
| _The Lacuna_ Barbara Kingsolver | I loved _The Poisonwood Bible_, I hope to enjoy this.  Haven't listened to it yet. 
| _The Language Instinct_ Steven Pinker | This is a real scientific exploration of where language comes from.  It's realistic, it's honest, it's thoughtful.  I love this book. 
| _Life of Pi_ Yann Martel | A really epic book. Loved it. 
| _The Lost Gospel of Judas Iscariot_ Bart Ehrman | OK I'm a Bart Ehrman fan.  Excellent. 
| _Lush Life_ Richard Price | A really good, gripping crime novel. 
| _Maddaddam_ Margaret Atwood | - 
| _The Majesty of the Court_ Sandra Day O'Connor | It's a great book on the highest court in the land.  It's well written and I loved it. 
| _Make It In America_ Andrew N. Liveris | I love this book - a 1%er who actually claims to want to restore the American Middle Class. 
| _Misquoting Jesus_ Bart Ehrman | Another excellent Ehrman book.  Ehrman and Hedges ought to get together and go bowling. 
| _Mortality_ Christopher Hitchens | - 
| _Neverwhere_ Neil Gaiman | What a great book! 
| _One L_ Scott Turow | I wanted to be a Lawyer once - I read this when I wantsd the same things as Turow. 
| _Outliers - The Story of Success_ Malcolm Gladwell | My first MG book - loved it. 
| _The Poisonwood Bible_ Barbara Kingsolver | One of my favorite books - loved every page. 
| _The Razor's Edge_ W Somerset Maugham | Loved this book - Victorian England?  Very cool. 
| _Revelations - Visions, Prophesy and Politics in the Book of Revelation_ Elaine Pagels | Worth a re-read. Loved it. 
| _The Romantic Manifesto_ Ayn Rand | A decent book - I need to re-listen.  Do I still agree with her? 
| _The Science of Fear_ Daniel Gardner | - 
| _Screwed - The Undeclared War Against the Middle Class_ Thom Hartmann | Everybody ought to read this book.  The US is screwed. 
| _Sherlock Holmes - A Baker Street Dozen_ | Gielgud is a decent Holmes, Welles is a great Moriarty. This one will make a long trip go away without a fight. 
| _The Short Stories of Ambrose Bierce_ Ambrose Bierce | Such a great collection. 
| _Spin_ Robert Charles Wilson | Great scifi. 
| _A Thousand Splendid Suns_ Kahled Hosseini | This guy is excellent. This book taught me so much about Afghanistan. 
| _Timescape_ Gregory Benford | A good book starts with a good idea.  As it is impossible to travel through time, the author faces the facts and presents something that accompishes the same thing without pure fantasy.  Wow. 
| _Unorthodox - The Scandalous Rejection of My Hasidic Roots_ Deborah Feldman | Wasn't sure I'd like this book - it's a woman's perspective, and just being a man makes you feel at a low level like an outsider.  But I loved this book - every page was magical.
| _What the Dog Saw_ Malcolm Gladwell | - 
| _Whose Bible is is Anyway?_ Jaroslav Pelikan | a good history of scripture, how it came to be.  Worthy of a re-read. 
| _The Woman in White_ Wilkie Collins | - 
| _The World is Flat_ Thomas L Friedman | It's a well-written book but I disagree with the conclusions it draws. 
| _The Year of the Flood_ Margaret Atwood
