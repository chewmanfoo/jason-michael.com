Do you have a bucket list?  It seems like something a psychiatrist or life couch encourages someone to create and maintain, but I don't really see the average Joe-on-the-street having a formal bucket list.  But that's the perfect reason to write one up now.

#### A bucket list for lazy tech people

*  Make some money on the internet.  I mean, recieve payments which sum to more than the cost of producing and maintaining 
   the item you're selling.  This might also include day-trading.
*  Buy the Mac Pro and the 4K display.
*  Visit London, Paris, Moscow, Bejing.
*  Get a good night's rest for an extended period of time (long enough so that you can tell the difference).
*  Become a critical member of an open-source project, so that you're recognized in IRC, mentioned on thank-you pages, 
   have remarkable statistics in bug lists etc.
*  Become a Youtube personality.  Bizarre as it may be, some people who have no more skill than you or I make a decent 
   living on Youtube. How do they do it?
*  Mine 1 bitcoin some how, some way.
*  Tesla Model S.  See: [here](http://theoatmeal.com/comics/tesla_model_s)
*  In fact, come to think of it, to Be Nikola Tesla would be pretty damn cool.  Maybe, more realistically, to use my soldering iron more frequently.
*  Minecraft in the real world.
