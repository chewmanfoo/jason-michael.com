How does a lack of complete, truthful information affect the earning and buying habits of consumers in the United States?  We'll focus here on middle-class
consumers, since they make up a vast majority of earners and buyers in this country.

What I'm on about is this: It seems like the more I know about our economy, the more I discover that I didn't know before.  Whether it be our monetary
policy, or the Central Bank, or consumer credit.  For example, do most borrowers know that 40% of us have credit scores in the 500's?.  Isn't it critical
to our systems of credit that people who are being punished be made to feel that they are in the minority?  It seems so.

And what about wages?  People don't normally know how much their peers are earning in the same company, much less across the industry.  If they knew this
information easily, they might be more willing to leave one firm to join another.  So their ignorance of relative salaries serves to support the industry's
need for stable labor and rock-bottom prices.  I heard of a company a few years ago who made it policy to share the salaries of every employee in order to
motivate and encourage the staff to an enlightened-self-interest striving for success.  But were they depicted as a modern day Twentieth Century Motor
Company (no John Galt mentioned, but surely his presence was felt, laboring in silence on the fringes.) [Link](http://thinkprogress.org/economy/2014/06/27/3454083/sumall-wage-transparency/) (maybe)  

How about monetary policy?  Do borrowers understand the concept of fractional reserve and what that means? Supposed I had $10,000, and got a lease with a
local strip mall and put up a sign "Jason's Savings and Loan".  Could I loan out $90,000?  Where would I get the money?  Presumably from loans from other
banks doing the same thing.  Follow that chain up higher and higher, and ultimately, don't you find a bank somewhere in the Caymans with an locked tight,
empty vault? Crucial question here is _where do I get that money_? Assume I had 9 customers who each borrowed $10,000. They all go to my new ATM and enter
their PIN and withdraw $10,000 each. This means I would have to have had $90,000 in the ATM before the last customer hit *withdraw*. But where did I get that
cash?  If I didn't have it in my wallet, I would get it from another bank. Perhaps I would get it on credit. Perhaps the other bank's policy is that I can
borrow $90,000 if I can prove I have $10,000 in assets in my posession.  I wonder if the loans to the 9 customers I have count in my assets in some way?

_But, dear writer, you provide many questions, and no answers._  Here is what I have concluded from musing about this for the last 15 minutes: humans are
rational creatures and we expect complex solutions to complex problems to be rational. It isn't that we fear not understanding the solutions, but we
certainly fear when the solutions are incomprehensible. Such is the case with finance. It's created to solve a complex problems, and in the process, to
make the implementers of the solutions immensely rich. This is undeniable. It's as if the designer of nuclear energy figured out how to get a deposit of
$1 to appear in his personal checking account every time 1 volt of nuclear energy is released in a fission reaction. Finance is also anchored on the backs
of _hope_ and _trust_, for where would we be without an ingrained desire to see a project successful, and how would we ever accomplish such a collaborative
enterprise without relationships with others more powerful than ourselves? Further, finance is created to avoid, politely, _difficult questions_.  How would
it be if a city asked, "How can we afford the new opera house?" and the banker replied, "You can never afford such a frivolous creation!"? So very sad and
so very uncomfortable. So here we are with a system designed to make some people very rich and to keep everyone else confused, dependent, trusting and
hopeful.  What a crock of shit finance is!
