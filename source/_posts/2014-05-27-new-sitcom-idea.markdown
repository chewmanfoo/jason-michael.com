A sitcom about an electrician (plumber?) with a wonderful secret.  18 months ago, he won the Megaball lottery, and he now has $180 million dollars in the bank.  We don't reveal this information until midway through the season. He continues to work, eat a humble lunch, drive a beat-up old car, struggle with the daily struggles of the middle class.

The main character has a common name, like Dave.  He lives in Philadelphia, he has a wife and two daughters - one beautiful, one plain.  The beautiful daughter cycles through boyfriends while the plain daughter (Daria?) has one throughout the show.  The boyfriend's name is Adam (Noah) and he's a preacher's son and a very vocal atheist.  He's a philosopher and Dave often goes to him for advice.  

The wife and daughters try to approach their dad about the money, but he always cuts them off - the audience might get the impression that they're talking about a health problem (maybe Dave has cancer he won't talk to the Dr about).
