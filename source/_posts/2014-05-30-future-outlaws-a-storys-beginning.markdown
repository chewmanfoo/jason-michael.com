Lucas leaned against the saddle, reaching with his boot to push a half-blackened log into the fire. 
He pulled the worn woolen blanket up high on his chest to fight back the bitch night's biting cold and glanced again through the thicket and across the valley floor. 
Out in the distance, perhaps 300 yards away, he could see the tiny spark of a campfire. 
Lucas was camping and freezing on this side of the valley, his enemy was camping on the other side. 

Lucas pulled his display glass from his breast pocket and tapped it to life. 
High above, a hovering drone woke and began its obedient, silent descent, opening its iris and focusing on the ground below.
Lucas tapped a command on the glass and the screen refreshed.
In the video screen, he could see the distant campfire from above.
Presently, Lucus could see his enemy prying the lid from a can of beans.
"Well I'll be damned.  The bastard's got food!", Lucas muttered in disgust. He hadn't eaten so much as a morsel in 4 days.

Lucas sat in disgust for a long while.  He heard a rustling in the brush nearby and instinctively turned his head to see what he was hearing.
At the same time, his stomach growled and the rustling stopped.  "Well, hell!" he muttered in disgust, threw off his blanket and stood up with a groan.
His knees both fired off like gunshots.  He reached down in his boot and pulled out his knife, and slowly began to creep toward the sound he'd heard.

Down the valley toward the river was a short shrub with long, sharp thorns.  It's trunk near the ground was covered with leaves and compost.
The rustling was coming from those leaves.  Maybe a rabbit?

He heard the rustle again.  In a flash, he lept forward onto his belly, hands groping in the dark leaves.
He seized a rather large lizard by the leg and tail, and plunged his knife into it's chin, cutting its head in half in one swift motion.
He turned and sat down, triumphantly.  A trickle of blood crawled down his cheek from the scratch where the thorns had taken their payment.

An hour later he was nestled in his blanket again, roasted lizard meat filling his stomach.  He smiled in satisfaction.
Lucas hadn't hunted in the wild for food in many years.  One had to be careful what you ate in the wilderness.
It had only been a century since the last nuclear war had ravaged the land.
He tucked the damp lizard skin in his shirt pocket and tilted his had brim down.  Soon he drifted off to sleep.  He dreamed about women and whiskey.
