You're heard the term 'Fail Fast' bandied about in buzzword-laiden discussions of how startups should do day-to-day work.  But what does it really mean?  Until today, I had the impression that 'Fail Fast' meant 'Don't be afraid to fail", emphasis on _Fail_.  But I have come to understand it as "Get busy, you lazy bum!", emphasis on _Fast_.

I've been watching the HBO comedy Silicon Valley.  It's OK - no critique belongs here but suffice it to say, as I work in IT, I am not surprised at anything in the show which attempts to emulate the life of an engineer.  Mike Judge is no engineer.  Enough critiqueing.

In the show, you see a typical silicon valley startup with a cool product they are trying to get into the market.  They are surrounded by countless other startups with the same goals and similarly good products.  One of the characters even meets a guy working in an office supply store who has an app he's trying to market.  Bottom line, as my high school gym coach used to say, "Ideas are like feet: everybody's got at least two and they often stink."  So, you say you've got a great idea?  That's super, but don't get ahead of yourself.  Lots of people have great ideas.

What is unique about the show is how many of those people with great ideas have already *produced the 1.0*.  This is what separates the dreamers from the workers - doing something with your idea.  But note that, in the show, everybody has a 1.0.  So, here's rule #2 - don't be surprised if you meet a lot of people who have realized their ideas and now have a viable product.  You thought you were special when you had the great idea, but after you produce the 1.0, now you're not so special any more.  Sorry about that.

*Fail Fast* means as quickly as you can, get in amongst the group of people who have produced a 1.0.  Show them your 1.0.  Get your 1.0 in the market.  At this point you might encounter failure.  Don't be afraid of failure. Failure is instructive - the one thing you can control which differentiates you from all the other people in the 1.0 club is how many times you've failed before, and how much you've learned from your failure.  So, Fail Fast!
