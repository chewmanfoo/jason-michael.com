I'm working with Paul on a new story idea which is basically a Handy Manny, but Manny is a composer of classical music, and the tools are instruments.
It sounds like it's going to be a great effort.  
The story arc, such as it is at this early stage, is in my mind really compelling and Pixar-worthy :)
Can you hear me, Pixar?
