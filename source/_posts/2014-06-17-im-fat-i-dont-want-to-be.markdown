It's easy to admit you're overweight with your kids.  They love me for me - they love their fat daddy.  But no matter how good that feels, I still can't find a shirt I look good in - my belly bulges out in front of me and my back constantly hurts.  I have chest pain occasionally and numb arms.  I'm a big fat sweaty mess.

So what am I going to do about it?

Well, that's tricky.  First, I don't seem to be able to lose weight, no matter what I do. The gut is a conveyor belt lined with workers (pickers) snatching the boxes (nutrients) off the belt. Clearly, the pickers work as hard as they can, but some nutrients fall off the end of the belt. The sum of all boxes on the belt is your total calorie intake - the boxes that fall off the end of the belt is whatever comes out in your poop. The boxes the pickers grab are processed and turned to sugars and vitamins/minerals for your nutrition. Apparently, I eat more than the pickers need, so much so that when I cut back on eating, it makes no difference with respect to my weight.  

I noticed that when I stay up late at night, I always have to have a snack.  It's always water, plus a salty snack (pretzels, pop corn, Doritos, salted nuts), and then a sweet snack (cookies, ice cream), and then, as the night wears on, a salty snack again and the cycle continues.  I usually consume at least an additional meal in calories when I stay up late at night.  But in the past two weeks I have stayed up late about 8 nights, and on each night I have only consumed water and fruit.  And still I'm north of 270 on the scale.

My buddy Paul has been running marathons since December - he just set his mind to it, got in a group of runners so he has peer support (he's so smart that way) and he accomplished it.  He started by walking with a Fitbit.  So I decided I'd do that as well - why not?  My iPhone 5s has a pedometer built in so I use the Argus app to track my steps.  Over the past 2 month, I have averaged 9,200 steps per day - almost 10,000.  That's every day - weekends included.  I haven't lost a single solitary pound.  Seems like overkill.

So I have this walking thing locked in.  I know what I need to do every day to maintain my 10,000 steps, and I know I can do it.  But what should I do next?  Every time I try running I get needling pain in my chest.  I've had chest pain for about 10 years - it started when I was in college.  A buddy of mine let me help out with his chimney business, sweeping chimneys and doing minor masonry work.  He won a bid to tear down a huge red brick chimney and I ended up at the top of the ladder in a loving embrace with a jack hammer for the weekend.  On Monday that weekend, I had a sharp pain in my chest which lasted long enough to force me to go to the school clinic about it.  After x-rays and stress tests and the like, they couldn't find anything wrong so they told me to take it easy and the pain would subside.  It did but it's always with me.

Anyway, I've signed up for a 1/2 marathon in December.  I'll keep you posted how my training goes.

*_update_* On Sunday I ran a 1/4 mile in about 5 minutes (felt like an hour).  I remember feeling really weak about 10 steps before I stopped, but my chest wasn't hurting at all.  After I stopped running, my shin splits flared up and I literally limped home, all the while brainstorming for ways to make this pain go away.  Humble beginnings.
