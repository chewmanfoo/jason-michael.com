Two and a half weeks ago, while sitting at my desk at home, I somehow injured my back.  I stood up to get a drink of water, and I felt a truly
evil stab in my right lower back about 2 inches to the right of my butt.  The pain was intense and debilitating.  I still feel pain now,
although it has somehow subsided a bit.  It feels as though something has grown around the pain and is trying to shield me from it,
but occasionally it still flares up.

I went to the doctor last Saturday.  He prescribed rest, icing for two days, then heating and stretching for the remainder of two weeks.  He did not offer
any drugs, I did not ask for any.  But, as I am not able to sleep well with the pain and I am impeded in driving, sitting at my desk, even using the bathroom
(I'll refrain from any further detail in that regard), I wish he had given me the strongest narcotic available sometimes.  It hurts to cough, it hurts to laugh. I can't pick up my kids to hug them.  My life currently sucks.

As I am forced to deal with the pain as the injury heals, I thought I would spend some time researching the causes and various treatments of lower back pain.

## Causes
from [link](http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/007425.htm):

   * Compression fractures to the spine from osteoporosis
   * Cancer involving the spine
   * Fracture of the spinal cord
   * Muscle spasm (very tense muscles)
   * Ruptured or herniated disk
   * Sciatica - pain that radiates along the path of the sciatic nerve 
   * Spinal stenosis (narrowing of the spinal canal)
   * Spine curvatures (like scoliosis or kyphosis), which may be inherited and seen in children or teens
   * Strain or tears to the muscles or ligaments supporting the back

also

   * An abnormal aortic aneurysm that is leaking
   * Arthritis conditions, such as osteoarthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and rheumatoid arthritis
   * Infection of the spine (osteomyelitis, diskitis, abscess)
   * Kidney infection or kidney stones
   * Problems related to pregnancy
   * Medical conditions that affect the female reproductive organs, including endometriosis, ovarian cysts, ovarian cancer, or uterine fibroids

## Treatment

### Ice

As soon as the injury occurs, start icing the area. Apply ice for 20 minutes at a time so you won't damage your skin.
Keep applying ice all day long for the first 48 hours. Ice reduces inflammation.

### Heat

After the icing, switch to heating.  Get a heating pad and crank that sucker up and sit on it all day long.  No need to rest the skin as you did with ice.  
Heat releaves pain.

### Drugs

Start with Aleve or Advil, move on to Tylenol Arthritis (some people say it really helps). Your doctor may prescribe more drugs if the pain is intense,
but muscle relaxers and pain killers usually impair you so you shouldn't drive when you're taking them.

### Chiropracty

They can take x-rays, prescribe drugs, get you to stand and twist. They're experts on the spine so they'll know probably better than your doctor how to help you.
The only trick is, Chiropracty is not always covered by your health plan, so check first. A chiropractor friend I know recommends "800mg Advil every 4 hours
unless you've been told not to take Advil before".  You heard it here, first! 

_*Follow-Up*_ I have been taking 800mg (4 liquigels) of Advil twice a day since Friday. I have experienced quite a lot of healing by doing so. I would not
have believed it, but apparently, in addition to providing pain relief (it really does work), Ibuprofen provides some healing function as well by reducing
swelling which allows blood to get in and heal the area.  I suspect in about a week, I'll be back on top.     

### Surgery

According to the Mayo Clinic [link](http://www.mayoclinic.org/back-surgery/art-20048274), back surgery is costly and sometimes doesn't work. Explore other
options, get a second opinion before agreeing to surgery. Common surgerys remove ruptured discs, remove bone spurs, implant replacement discs or fuse bones
to provide additional support.
 
## Prevention

Think about your typical work day. If you arrive at work, stay at your desk all day long, stopping for a bathroom break or two and to go to lunch, you're
at high risk for back pain. To mitigate risk, get you every hour on the hour and take a walk, stretch, touch your toes etc. Don't spend the entire day
sitting in an office chair.

If you have a gut (like I do), get rid of that annoying bastard. It takes two things to rid yourself of the gut: diet and exercise. This never goes away.
On the diet front, you just have to understand that some foods are *poison*, and you should stop eating them. Sodas, twinkies, cheese burgers, candy.  Evil.
Exercise: walk 10,000 steps every day as a baseline for a healthy life.  Every.  Day.
