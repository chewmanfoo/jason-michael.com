I don't remember ever feeling so depressed coming into the Christmas holidays. I think about what's going on in my life right
now, and I can't think of anything that is causing it, but I am having a hard time shaking the blues.
<!-- more -->
Here is a list of factors that are affecting my current outlook:

### New Years Resolutions

We're less than a month away from the day when everybody makes half-hearted promises to themselves. I do the same thing. I never
follow through. Rarely do people stop gossiping, or lose weight, or put more money into savings, or get into shape, or stop
smoking just because they tell themselves they'll do it on the first day of the year. But it still bugs me that I can't seem to
make any progress on any of my life goals. That's a bit of a downer.

### Money

I just finished Consumer Credit Counseling. That's a good thing, right? Yes, I'd recommend it to anyone with a lot of high
interest consumer debt. Essentially, an office of nice ladies manages paying your bills every month, for a few years. You just
have to make your debt repayment payment without fail. But in my case, I finished CCCS just in time to start paying my college
loans. So it's out of the frying pan into the fire. Why do I owe so much college debt? Three degrees, two with private schools
will do that to ya. Why did I do that? For the same reason millions of kids do it every year - you graduate high school and you
are stupid. You meet a college finance official who tells you "the average college debt of a professional is $100,000" and you
don't feel any fear or discomfort. You're bullet-proof. That's the way it is in the US. Meanwhile, in Germany, college tuition 
is now 100% free to German citizens. And to poke a schnitzel-stained thumb in Uncle Sams eye, it's now free to US citizens who
immigrate. Thanks Obama!

### Politics

People are getting murdered by police officers all over the country - and Grand Jury's are failing to indict the officers. Eric
Garner's killer used a choke hold to kill him - a practice that is banned by his police force, but he still did nothing wrong,
according to a panel of upstanding citizens in Staten Island. People are still demanding to see the President's birth 
certificate. People still believe that Socialized Medicine belongs in Communist Russia but not here in the land of the free.
Recently, Democrats ran campaigns where they distanced themselves from the President, and lost an astounding amount of political
power in congress. On a related note: Megyn Kelly is still hot. That durian should have soured on the vine years ago.

*Update:* ok ok maybe 'murder' is a strong word. I have heard a lot of arguments from the conservative side since I wrote that 
and I'd like to address them. First: if you're saying people shouldn't challenge police authority and if they do, then they
shouldn't complain, then I fear the kind of world you're advocating. I'm not a police officer. I don't have police officers in my
family (other than a really good guy who is a second cousin on my wife's side). So I don't know a damn thing about being a police
officer. But I do know that Eric Garner was confronted by an officer in Staten Island because he was selling cigarettes in
singles. He was unarmed. He had words with the officer, he resisted arrest (at least as it appears in the video). He was
gang-tackled by a bunch of planeclothes cops, one of whom put him in a choke hold, and he ended up dying. It doesn't seem right.
If you're commenting on this tragedy, please watch the video carefully, and focus, if you can, on the incident itself - not the 
overall state of white-black relations or institutional racism or crime. Was the police officer performing the choke hold in
any danger? Were the police officers on the scene completely aware of the situation? As a private citizen, are you allowed by the
law to break up a fight? If you do so, do you expect to be arrested? Is the sale of cigarettes in singles cause for a gang-tackle
and arrest? Did this man really have to die? If the cop had said "move along", would justive have been served? And most 
importantly, is the violation of department policy that results in a death really something a Grand Jury ought not to indict on?
 
### A Declining Mind

Here's a little chestnut: you hear people quip "that's sign of a declining mind". Do you know what that means? It means the food
you eat is getting into your blood producing fatty acids which are being mushed into a plaque that is clogging the blood vessels
in your brain. I have a tankless water heater. I have to flush the system with vinegar once a year to keep mineral deposits from
clogging the capillary pipes and preventing the system from working properly. So the same crap that is screwing up my tankless
water heater is also happening in my brain. And worse: I have a solution for my water heater, but not my brain. In 30 years, the
precious memories of my children will start to disappear, thanks to this Egg McMuffin. Ain't that a kick in the neck?

Ho ho ho.
