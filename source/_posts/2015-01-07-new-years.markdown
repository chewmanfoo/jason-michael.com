It's 2015. I'm trying to get motivated. I feel like, if I focus hard enough, I'll be able to perhaps, possibly get some motivation to do something that would
make the last year's accomplishments look like amateurish, though admirable attempts. Let's start with a list of goals for the new year! 
<!-- more -->
## Personal Goals
   1. I need to lose 30 pounds and keep it off.  I know how to do the formaer, but I don't know how to do the latter. My body seems to want to sit at almost exactly 100 pounds over my goal weight according to doctors. I can really feel the effects of this added mass hanging around my waist.
   2. I need to save at least 1 month's salary in a fluid account.
   3. I need to finish some remodeling in my house. 
   4. I want to add a whole-house vacuum system as a bonus. The wife will love it.

## Work Goals
   1. I need to write an app I can be responsible for maintaining on a daily basis.
   2. I need to master including javascript in my projects.

## Woodworking
   1. I want to finish the garage workshop, including:
      * complete the new walls, sheathing, insulation, painting
      * add a new bandsaw, dust collection
   2. I need to finish all the jig projects I have planned
   3. I need to finish the work table I have planned
   4. I need to build an assembly table/bench
   5. I need to finish out my storage room
