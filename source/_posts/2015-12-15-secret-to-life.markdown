So, yeah.  It's Christmas Time and I'm thinking deep thoughts.  I'm waking up early in the morning, sneaking into my kids rooms, peeking at them asleep in bed, covers pulled up to the chin revealing their little feet.
I'm thinking about joy, what it takes to have more of it in this world. Only a month ago, terrorists armed with bombs and assault rifles attacked Paris, killing hundreds.  Paris!  Imagine it: a city bursting with so
much love it even has a bridge covered with padlocks symbolizing couples' devotion. A couple of weeks ago, similarly minded folks tried to do the same thing in San Bernadino.  Seems like the whole world's gone crazy.
But my kid's little cold feet remind me there is always another story playing.  And the tree is surrounded by many presents, wrapped up in pretty paper with bright ribbons and bows.

What makes a man happy in this world? I'm convinced the answer is one of those poignant mysteries that boggles the mind:

* The best sleep is when you crash in the bed, dog tired after a hard day's work
* The best drink is cold water, when you're completely parched
* The best hug is when you get off a 27-hour flight after being gone a month
* The best meal is when you're starving
* The best love is when you're feeling affection for the first time in a long time, after a terrible break-up (I'm told)

So, if you want to be really happy all the days of your life, stay hungry, stay thirsty, work hard, travel far, don't be afraid to say good-bye.  

I'm sure this isn't an altogether original thought, but it's the thought I had, that kept me awake last night.
