Here's some memes which ought to appear in any good adventure story, in no
particular order:

<!-- more -->
   * *Hero* - the Hero is often an ordinary person, thrust into extraordinary
circumstances, who must rise to the occasion to battle a Villain who threatens
either the Hero's life or the lives of the Hero's loved ones, or perhaps the
whole world.
   * *Villain* - the Villain is often evil, extremely powerful.
   * *Hero's Friends* - the Hero is often surrounded by close friends or
relatives who begin as casual aquaintances but who grow to love the Hero enough
to give their lives for the Hero's success.
   * *Villain's Underlings* - the Villain is often surrounded by companions who
are bound to the Villain by either close friendship, in the case of a not-so-
evil Villain, or blackmail or some other sinister method, in the case of a truly
evil Villain. The Villain may have a close-friend-companion if the Villain is
truly evil, but this companion must also be truly evil, and serves as a foil or
model for comparison to the evil aspects of the Villain.
   * *Mentor* - the Hero begins as nothing but potential.  The Hero meets a 
Mentor, who teaches the Hero how to perform feats which are essential to the 
Hero's success, even if it is not obvious at the time.  
   * *Complex Plot* - a long-forgotten villain or mentor plans a complex Plot to
achieve some goal. The Hero and his comrades struggle to understand the Plot in
order to know what is to come.
   * *Fate* - reader should be made to feel, or hero struggles against the
certainty that Fate will will after all, regardless of their efforts
   * *Visiting a Grave* - main characters ought to visit the grave of a parent,
relative or foe
   * *Fateful Friendship* - if the Villain ultimately threatens the whole world,
 it is often the case that the Hero, who ultimately defeats the Villain, was
once a close personal frend of the Villain at an earlier time.
   * *Hero's Death is Breakthrough to Adulthood* - The Hero remains a child 
until they experience personal death, which transforms them into the adult Hero
who can vanquish the Villain.
   * *What Hero Wants, What Hero Wants Most* - all throughout the story, we are
told about the hero's daily wants and needs, and we watch as the Hero fulfills
those wants and needs.  But early in the story, often even in the first scene,
we see what the Hero wants most of all. For example, in Die Hard, the Hero's
failed marriage is featured in the first act.    
   * *Long Forgotten, Remembered* - The Hero possesses an item, perhaps a gift,
that is kept safe and forgotten about.  Later in the story it is remembered and
its significance is discovered.    
   * *The Forrest* - there is often a literal forrest within the story that
represents a great unknown tat has to be overcome to achieve the Hero's goals.
   * *Twins* - twins present very interesting characters in a story. A common variation is "Good Twin/Evil
Twin", where the audience is encouraged to side with one of the twins, but is given a glimpse of the power
available to the other side of the story. An Evil Twin definitely represents a formidable opponent. 
   * *Codes, Cyphers, Anagrams* - a code or anagram that no one can solve, and one that is definitely not
obvious to the audience, is a good plot device.
