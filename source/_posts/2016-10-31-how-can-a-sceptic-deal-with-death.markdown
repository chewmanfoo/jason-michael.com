I am not currently dealing with any grief, I have not recently lost anyone close to me.  My dad died 2 years
ago last month, and I guess that still stings a bit. But I have been thinking a bit lately about how skeptics
can deal with the loss of a loved one without the comfortable illusions of the Bosom of Abraham or the
afterlife, etc. Musing on this one day, and completely out of the blue, I wondered, do I think that Harry
Potter is dead? Obviously, Hary Potter never existed in any real sense, however I personally know a lot of
details about his life because I have read stories about him and I enjoyed those stories. I think fondly about
Harry Potter, and I remember him in a positive way and perhaps I always will. His essence is locked in my mind
in a quiet place. Memories of Harry Potter can still bring a smile to my face.

It occurs to me that, in a similar way,  I could begin to tell myself stories about my father. In those stories,
I could recall positive envents in my memory where my father played a heroic role, times when I admired him,
where his own special personality made a positive impact and changed the world for the better. Certainly there
are powerful negative memories as well, times when my father played the villain, and when I did not feel
positively about him. But I can choose to edit those memories out of his story if I choose, or instead keep
those negative memories in, alive in his story for as long as I continue to remember anything.

Thus, I can tell myself stories about my father, and he will remain alive in my mind forever, alongside Harry
Potter.
