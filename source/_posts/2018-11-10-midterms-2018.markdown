Our midterm elections came and went on last Tuesday.  In Texas, we all rallyed around Beto O'Rourke, but our hopes were dashed as the reptile Ted Cruz won by about
220,000 votes (around 2.6%).  It was doubly disappointing because, where I live in Tarrant County, we saw so many Beto yard signs, and we could easily see a blue wave
rising up.  Everybody around us seemed to be of one mind: _It's time for the Tea Party to Go!_ Unfortunately, we failed to reach everyone, apparently.  Tarrant and
Dallas counties both went for Beto, as did every big city in Texas: Dallas, Austin, Houston, San Antonio, Corpus Christi, but rural voters carried Cruz over the finish line. Ted Cruz being the most hated man in politics notwithstanding, he remains our Senator for six more terrible years.

Why do we hate Ted Cruz so much?  Is it because he so publicly humbled himself before Trump after the election?  He only reacted in a predictable way.  After 
all, Democrats fall in love, Republicans fall in line.  Is it because he esposes so many repugnant ideals, as if he enjoys revolting most people?  He once said the US
ought to carpet bomp the Middle East so we could 'see if sand glowed in the dark.'  And he thinks the 'definition of marriage [ought to be] decided by the states rather
than the federal government.  Any time anyone ever says 'let the States decide', think segregation.  His ideas are backward, that's for sure.
But really, it's his smugness that annoys me the most.  He has all the makings of a rat bastard.  He's notorious for haveing a _Backpfeifengesicht_ (German for 'a face
that deserves a slap')  Most people, if they saw Ted Cruz on the street burning alive, would offer him a cup of cold gasoline.  And a majority of my fellow Texans chose
this troll to represent us.  Letting that sink in is like settling in for a long nap in a pit of quicksand.  Nausea and terror mixed together and served in an old rusty
syringe.
Gross.
2020 will change things.  People have got to wake up before it's too late.
