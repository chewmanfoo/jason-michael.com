So, our midterm elections came and went on last Tuesday.  In Texas, we all rallyed around Beto O'Rourke, but our hopes were dashed as the reptile Ted Cruz won by about
220,000 votes (about 2.6%).  It was doubly disappointing because where I live in Tarrant County, we saw so many Beto yard signs, and we could easily see a blue wave
rising up - everybody around us seemed to be of one mind: _It's time for the Tea Party to Go!_. Unfortunately, we failed to reach everyone, apparently.  Tarrant and
Dallas counties both went for Beto, as did every big city in Texas, but rural voters carried Cruz over the finish line.
