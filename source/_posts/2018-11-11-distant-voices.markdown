In the current age of Internet interrelationships, where fewer and fewer people participate in fewer and fewer face-to-face interractions with other humans,
(at least it seems that way from my perspective), we are seemingly living in a strikingly new world.  It was in this world that I had a strange thought today.
I was listening to [_The Majority Report_](https://www.youtube.com/user/SamSeder/videos?app=desktop) podcast on YouTube, while sitting in my pajamas sipping coffee in the early morning.  My family was still asleep.

On the podcast came John, from San Antonio.  The podcast is part liberal propaganda, part call-in show.  John from San Antonio is always an interesting caller.
He rattles off voting and demographic statistics like Siri on a bender, and today he was particularly energetic.  I was a few days behind listening to a podcast that
had aired originally on November 7th, and John was talking about the Midterms.

I thought about hearing the voice of John from San Antonio.  The sound of his voice, part Midwest vanilla, part Texas molasses.  The spark of intelligence that his
word choice conveyed.  John from San Antonio is an interesting fellow.  He's a part of _The Majority Report_, and he's a part of my life as well, in a small way.
As with any cherished item, I fear that John from San Antonio will go away some day.  Maybe he'll get a job that requires that he be less vocal about his politics.
Maybe he'll switch sides and go all in for Trump.  Maybe he'll be hit by a bus.

I hope you keep rattling off voting stats till I breathe my last, John from San Antonio.  You're a distinct voice in a sea of noise.
