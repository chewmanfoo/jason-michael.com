I have recently deleted my Facebook account.  I did so rather compulsively, following a disheartening exchange between myself and a band of Trump supporters
regarding what liberals should do following the 2018 mid-term elections, which, at the time, I felt a bit of disappointment about.  My favorite candidate, Beto
O'Rourke failed to defeat the horrible Ted Cruz in a run for a US Senate seat in Texas.  So, I posted as many others had, that Democrats need to steer the party
to the left, and that working Americans no longer really felt akin to Democratic arguments.  Many union members had voted for Trump in the last election, and I felt
a need to reach out to them.  But this was Facebook, and my Trump-supporting 'friends' took this as an opportunity to ridicule the left perspective, and plaster
all over my page all sorts of idiotic memes chock full of propaganda culled from the deepest assholes of Russian bots.  Ironically, as political observations go,
I was even wrong in my reaction to the 2018 Blue Wave.  The turnover of House seats in 2018 was the biggest in American history, according to [Newsweek](https://www.newsweek.com/republicans-midterms-popular-vote-worst-ever-1226441).  

Much of what was splashed on my Facebook page that day was accusations that I hadn't thought carefully enough about my politics.  One never feels like they haven't
thought about something they believe, but be that as it may, I am willing to examine my liberal assumptions.  However, I bet it's going to be quite difficult.  Any 
faithful attempt to examine one's assumptions is like trying to rid your attic of rats.  You can't see all of them, and if you don't get them all, you'll have the same
horde scratching in the dark in a few weeks.  Rule of thumb on rat elimination is to control their methods of egress, i.e. block the holes they use to move in and
out of your home, and set lots of traps.  But this whole effort is rather hopeful.  One can never know if you've gotten all the holes, and setting traps is rather
like fishing. You try, and hope for success.  Much in the same way, scraping your mind for assumptions is an abstract, asiprational exercise. It's non-trivial to list
all your assumptions at the start because it is unclear when you're done. And of course, while you're trapping them, you have to be sure new assumptions don't slip 
in in secret. What a mess! Nevertheless, I'll try.

_Post script: I'm also noticing that many of these assumptions more resemble beliefs.  Be that as it may..._

## Organizational Assumptions
I assume that government's chief role today is to oppose global business. This is a government which functions for all people as the framers of the Constitution
intended it, but this is not the government we find ourselves ruled by today.  Our government today is an oligarchy of the uber-rich and those who seek to
be and will sell their mother to get on top. Returning to topic, Government should be as strong as global business is.  But current Republicans want a weaker
government because they claim that a strong government endangers personal liberty.  The person they envision having the liberty, however, is the billionaire.   

I assume that collectivism is both a natural construct of the human experience, and the most efficient way to get things done.  I recall a news story I heard
the other day which informs this topic.  A leader of a political movement was murdered.  The reporter was marvelling at how the movement continued, even though
the murder had been so aggregious and henious. Why do political movements continue, even though individuals who comprise those movements may fall away, die or be
killed?  Because as humans we hunt in packs.  Attempts to divide us are unnatural and unwanted.

## Economic Assumptions
I assume that a government that spends less than it takes in in taxes, levy's and fees is a better government than one who borrows to pay for the things it wants.

I assume that when one government borrows from another, it is endebted to that other in more ways than cash.  I remember hearing about an issue with the Suez Canal
where the British govt of the 1970's was unable to exert pressure on an Arab state because it was in debt to the Arabs.  I can't remember the details.

I assume that a healthy economy on a micro and macro level requires a large body of consumers who have cash to purchase goods produced by a smaller body of
producers.  Some of the consumers will also be producers, or work for producers.  Thus the producer has incentive to treat the consumer fairly, or, the ratio
bends towards fairness, assuming the producer wants to be successful and can only do so by selling what she produces.  However, this win-win is not what we see
in markets today.  While it is unclear why, int he past half a century, we have seen producers choose to cheat, swindle, and otherwise mistreat their consumers
simply for shot-term gain.  Producers in the economies of today are killing the goose that lays the golden egg, and it is unclear why.  

## Social Assumptions
I assume that racism is both natural and avoidable.  Just as we men can be socialized not to rape women we find attractive given the opportunity, we can be trained
to respect people who occupy _The Other_.  But why should we?  Because we choose to, and after having chosen, we do not go back on our word.  Because brown-skinned
people are no real threat to us as a group.  Because immersing ourselves in the culture of _The Other_ enriches our own lives in immeasurable ways.

## Global Strategic Assumptions
I assume America could do without all the global hegemony, but only if our rich classes can tolerate the risk... and they can, they just don't want to.  I believe we
need to revisit our ideas about wealth.  Maybe I'll write about this another time.

I assume that leaders who claim to want to dominate the world haven't given it much thought.  Instead, they are just announcing which road they intend to take.  They have
yet to make any headway down that road, and thus aren't really prepared to have any real sense of the implications of their desire.  They are no threat to us.

I assume that nuclear weapons are a threat to global civilization because people could choose to use them, even if the consequences are catastrophic.
