I am willing to examine my liberal assumptions, however, any faithful attempt to examine one's assumptions is like trying to rid your attic of rats.  You can't see 
all of them, and if you don't get them all, you'll have the same horde scratching in the dark in a few weeks.  It's non-trivial to list all your assumptions at the
start because it is unclear when you're done. Nevertheless, I'll try.

## Government Assumptions
I assume that government's chief role today is to oppose global business. This is a government which functions for all people as the framers of the Constitution
intended it, but this is not the government we find ourselves ruled by presently.  Our government today is an oligarchy of the uber-rich and those who seek to
be and will sell their mother to get on top. Returning to topic, Government should be as strong as global business is.  But current Republicans want a weaker
government becuase they claim that a strong government endangers personal liberty.  The person they envision having the liberty, however, is the billionaire.   

## Economic Assumptions
I assume that a government that spends less than it takes in in taxes, levy's and fees is a better government than one who borrows from some entity who does.

I assume that when one government borrows from another, it is endebted to that other in more ways than cash.  I remember hearing about an issue with the Suez Canal
where the British govt of the 1970's was unable to exert pressure on an Arab state because it owed the state money.  I can't remember the details.

I assume that a healthy economy on a micro and macro level requires a large body of consumers who have cash to purchase goods produced by a smaller body of
producers.  Some of the consumers might also be producers, or work for producers.  

## Social Assumptions
I assume that racism is both natural and avoidable.  Just as we men can be socialized not to rape women we find attractive given the opportunity, we can be trained
to respect people who occupy _The Other_.  But why should we?  Because we choose to, and after having chosen, we do not go back on our word.  Because brown-skinned
people are no real threat to us as a group.  Because immersing ourselves in the culture of _The Other_ enriches our own lives in immeasurable ways.

## Global Strategic Assumptions
I assume American could do without all the global hegemony, but only if our rich classes can tolerate the risk... and they can, they just don't want to.  I believe we
need to revisit our ideas about wealth.  Maybe I'll write about this another time.
