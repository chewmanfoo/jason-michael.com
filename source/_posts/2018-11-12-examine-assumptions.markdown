I am willing to examine my liberal assumptions, however, any faithful attempt to examine one's assumptions is like trying to rid your attic of rats.  You can't see 
all of them, and if you don't get them all, you'll have the same horde scratching in the dark in a few weeks.  It's non-trivial to list all your assumptions at the
start because it is unclear when you're done. Nevertheless, I'll try.

# Economic Assumptions
I assume that a government that spends less than it takes in in taxes, levy's and fees is a better government than one who borrows from some entity who does.

I assume that when one government borrows from another, it is endebted to that other in more ways than cash.  I remember hearing about an issue with the Suez Canal
where the British govt of the 1970's was unable to exert pressure on an Arab state because it owed the state money.  I can't remember the details.

I assume that a healthy economy on a micro and macro level requires a large body of consumers who have cash to purchase goods produced by a smaller body of
producers.  Some of the consumers might also be producers, or work for producers.
