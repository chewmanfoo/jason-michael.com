Last night I had the most amazing dream.  This was the kind of dream that made you wake up with a big smile on your face, unaware of the traditional aches and pains of
getting older, desperate to tell someone else.  My wife and kids were getting ready to leave for school, but I had to stop my wife and give her a summary. Here's what
I dreamed:

I dreamed that all my brothers and sisters had returned to my parent's property some time in the near future.  Presently, the property is overgrown because no one is
currently living on it and all the exotic trees and shrubs my father planted on it have all gone wild in the tropical Texas climate.  But in the dream, the property
was as it was when I was a boy.  The fields were all mowed, the trees all trimmed, the trails all soft dirt, worn down by many sets of bare feet.

My mother and my wife's parents were there.  My sister and her family, and my younger brother who is estranged from the family, and his wife and daughters.  We were all
living in the main house, which was maintained and held all the family's well, but near bursting.  There was a metal building a bit larger about 50 yards north on the
property, a two story sheet metal structure with no windows, like a storage barn.  This was the structure my dad had built when my mom divorced him, which he lived in
until he died.  The structure was apparently unexplored by anyone, up to the time of the events in the dream. 

A family of gypsies had moved in on the property as well, and were unruly and difficult, presently setting fires to keep warm and endangering the forest and the 
structures my dad had built.  This element of the story was perhaps out of place, except that in real life, my sister and I have recently settled on how to pay the taxes
on the estate (we both pay half monthly), which has eased my mind because the property has finally been rescued from the tax man.  Perhaps the gypsies represent
strangers taking what is rightfully ours.

In the dream, I decide to explore dad's building.  I walked past my in-laws, who were discussing a set of stairs my father had built, which were extraordinary and a bit
dangerous, and I was ascending them daringly.  When I got to the top, I noticed that the top floor of the building was a finished out living area, complete with wood 
paneled walls, clever electrical work, lighting, a complete bathroom.  I followed a generous hallway down to a large room at the end of the building.  It was a master bedroom.  Along one wall was a massive fireplace.  I lit a fire in the fireplace, and was astonished by what was in the room.

The room was filled with all the clever knick-knacks and treasures I remember as a boy.  The walls had my Aunt Eara-Joe's oil paintings displayed, book cases were filled 
with my father's Zane Grey books, and books on horticulture, and a set of story books I remember as a child, which featured the Little Orphan Annie stories, and the tales
of Uncle Remus and Brer-Rabbit and Brer-Fox.  Along one wall was all the hand-carved Christmas ornaments my father had made, and whittlings made by my Uncle Fred when
he was alive, and board games we played, all well-preserved.  In front was a huge red and white Santa sleigh teeter-totter my father had built for us one Christmas.
Everything was spotless, as if no dust were ever allowed to settle in this sacred room.

In my dream, I sat down in the room and began to play, but my mind soon pulled away so that I could wake up and tell my wife and kids about what I had seen.

I think the dream was telling me that I should try harder to uncover the treasures of my past.  Memories are a precious thing, and we all too often let them slip away.
